Hide and Seek

For our final project we created a hide and seek game. We spent a while
trying to think of an original idea, and we came up with a playing field
where one player has more limited visibility. This would only work through
a network conneciton. 
One player can control a spotlight and attempts to click on the other character, 
a simple square. However, the more this spotlight moves the smaller it becomes,
and if the player ever clicks on the screen it becomes tiny. We hope this will
discourage players from scanning across the screen and clicking randomly.
The square player attempts to collect a series of blocks that are only visible
in its playing field. However, once it collects one of these blocks it lights 
up, becoming visible to the other player. These blocks are scattered randomly
about the playing field, but as the spotlight sees more of them light up it has
a stronger clue of where the square was recently and where it may be moving.
The spotlight can be controlled with the mouse, but if it moves too quickly it
will become smaller for a brief time. The spotlight player can use the mouse button
to click on the other player. The square player can use the arrow keys to move around
and attempt to collect the other blocks. Once one of the players win, the winning
player can decide to play again or quit by pressing p or q. If the player presses
q the game should start again, but if the player presses q both screens should close.
Simply open the game on two machines that connect to the same port to start playing.
We hope you enjoy!
note: we had better results when opening character.py first, then connecting
light.py
